    <h1>Redesigning the Nubo App</h1>
    <p>
      A complete redesign of two key flows — Home and Profile — to reduce friction and help students preparing for Brazil’s entrance exams join classes faster.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>My role:</strong> Lead UX/UI decision-maker</li>
      <li><strong>Team:</strong> 3 designers (I led most decisions)</li>
      <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 week (design → shipped)</li>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Mobile-first, speed of access to live classes</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Nubo is an app for high-school students preparing for ENEM and other entrance exams. The product existed, but its structure didn’t match how students navigated or consumed content. Students are often stressed and in a hurry — the product needed to respect that mindset.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The Home and Profile screens made the critical task — joining a live class — unnecessarily difficult. Students had no clear visibility of what was live, no intuitive schedule, and were abruptly redirected to external tools. Leadership reported ~90% abandonment during the year, ending with only ~16 active students in 2024.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PROCESS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Process & Trade-offs</h2>
    <p>
      With only one week, we focused on removing friction. I facilitated alignment between product, design, and engineering, making trade-offs to deliver a smaller scope with higher quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had to postpone the Agenda feature (deadlines, simulados, essays) despite having mid-fi wireframes. Instead, we prioritized: clear “Live now” entry, simpler navigation, and predictable external redirects.
    </p>

  <!-- SOLUTIONS -->

      <li>Redirect confirmation modal before leaving to Google Meet/YouTube</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Display of student name, RA, and enrollment status</li>
      <li>Clear Full-time vs Part-time distinction</li>
      <li>Simple photo upload flow (camera, gallery, or mascot avatar)</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- LEARNINGS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      Leading decisions under pressure taught me to balance speed and quality. I learned how to prioritize essential features, make trade-offs, and keep alignment across teams. Clarity and simplicity beat complexity every time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONCLUSION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This redesign wasn’t just UI polish — it was a focused effort to let students access what matters most: live classes, in less than 3 taps. By shipping a smaller but higher-quality scope, we built trust with students and leadership, and created a foundation for future improvements like the Agenda and teacher dashboards.
